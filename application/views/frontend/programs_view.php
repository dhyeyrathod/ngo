    <strong><u>Counseling &amp; Guidance to Needy Men &amp; Women </u></strong> <br>
            MAVA has in the last 21 years, provided&nbsp;face-to-face  &amp; telephonic counseling and guidance to over 20,000 men and women facing  marital conflict and other gender problems. This has been done through a  trained team of experienced counselors. Necessary legal support is also  provided by the organization. A heartening fact is that a large number of  distressed women , apart from men, have been approaching the organization.<br>
            <br>
            <strong><u> Youth Helpline for distressed youths</u></strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>MAVA started, in September 2009,  Yuva Maitri Telephonic Helpline (No. 022-26826062)</strong> for distressed youths across Mumbai  on problems, anxieties and dilemmas faced on matters of Relationships,  Sexuality and Violence. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><u>Gender Sensitization Programmes</u></strong> <br>
            Mass awareness programmes on gender issues for different target groups like school and college youth, community mandals, voluntary bodies, residential colonies and employees of business organizations are organized by MAVA. This is done by using different, innovative media like interactive workshop sessions, games, street-plays, essay and poster-competitions, wall- newspapers, radio-plays, poetry reading sessions, talks and discussions by veterans in the field. For the past 8 years, MAVA has been organizing special initiatives for young men on ‘Gender and Masculinity.’ The pioneering initiative, which began in Pune in 2006, has been spread to youths in over 6 other districts of Maharashtra. For details, see Information on Yuva Maîtri. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><u>Pre-marital Guidance</u></strong> <br>
            For the last 5 yrs.,  MAVA has been also organizing pre-marital guidance workshops (in English &amp;  Marathi) for boys &amp; girls desirous of marriage and needing basic inputs on  various aspects of marriage. Apart from one-day workshops, MAVA also arranges  personalized guidance on pre-marital aspects for individuals. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><u>Publication of 'Purush Spandana' (Male Vibrations)</u></strong> <br>
             MAVA brings out Purush Spandana (meaning male  vibrations) - an annual magazine in Marathi. Published since 1996, the magazine  contains short stories, first -person accounts, interviews, poems, analytical  articles and media-trends that voice sentiments of men. The subjects cover a  vast canvas of contemporary issues ranging from misuse of sex-determination  tests, dowry system, woman sexuality and male psyche. The writers hail from  varied professions. The said magazine is the first systematic effort by men to publish issues concerning men and women. Attempting to provide a platform (exclusively) for men, of varied age-groups and backgrounds, to spontaneously express their innermost thoughts on personal lives, upbringing, man-woman relationship, companionship, beauty, friendship, aspirations, vices, violence and various gender-related contemporary issues, the magazine provides fresh insights in understanding men's attitudes.

            <strong><u>Addressing Specific issues </u></strong> <br>
            In 1995, when a 19  year-old college girl Dipti Khanna was badly burnt by an acid attack in 1995,  MAVA raised over Rs. 75,000/- by appealing to well- wishers and members of the  public to contribute towards Dipti's medical treatment expenses. Most touching was the gesture of prisoners from Nashik Central Jail who sent Rs.11,000, putting in their savings. The underlying  issue behind the attack - the perpetrator's non-acceptance of a woman's  negative response, was discussed by MAVA activists at various levels.  Similarly, the issues of jilted love resulting in heinous forms of violence on  girls in various parts of Maharashtra and the public's apathy to these  incidents have been raised in a big way by MAVA in the last 7 yrs. On the  occasion of 8th March- International Women's Day, every year, MAVA organizes  symposia, workshops on contemporary gender issues like Section 498 A and  Domestic Violence, Misuse of Sex-Determination Tests, Child Sexual Abuse and  Sexual Harassment at the workplace . Men from the field of art and culture are  invited for the programmes to express their concerns and solidarity on gender  issues.<br><br>
            
         <strong><u>Networking with women's groups and like-minded bodies</u></strong><br>
            This is done through  referral of cases of domestic violence whenever their / MAVA's intervention is  required and by jointly organizing activities aimed at tackling specific gender  issues. Joining hands with leading women's bodies like Vacha, SNDT Women’s University, CORO, MAVA has been involved in projects which help youth in questioning  and changing 'stereotyped' roles of men &amp; women in society.<br><br>
            
          <strong><u>Organizing a series of one-day workshops on self-defense for women</u></strong> <br>
          Empowering them against  attacks by men on streets, in buses-trains or even in homes. Over 5000 women  from different backgrounds and age-groups, across the city, have participated  in these workshops. Requests for similar workshops from educational  institutions, corporate and specific groups have been coming to the  organization recently. </p>
